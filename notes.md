# Things to keep in mind for later

## Database
- `get_logged_user` should just return true/false if user data is not needed

## Job board
- Maybe add the follwoing filters later: distance, remote, salaries
- Have an onclick function that submits the changed query for each filter

## URL length
- Considering that Insta must have billions of posts saved, what do they do to keep their URLs short (e.g., `https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzPTMD3Rq3V/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link`)
- 
- save the raw json data, put a public id on it (maybe have subdirectories for each work field), add it to the end of the url

## routing
- Why can I access this: localhost:3000/pages/registered/job-board.php while not registered?








## What to focus on rn
AJAX for
- [ ] saving jobs
- [ ] loading more jobs at the end of the page
